# Morocco website to promote the book Tide Blade by author Aoife Conleavy
## Main purpose of the project is to learn advanced CSS styles, especially focusing on typography. Step-by-step instructions were provided by Codecademy to modify the typography on her site. 
 The following typography related changes were executed to make the page easier to read:
+ Changing the size
+ Changing the style
+ Changing font families
### By utilising git and publishing the final project on Github, I practised version control through the inbuilt terminal in VS code. Furthermore, transferring the code to VS code meant I had to practise creating folder structure and linking CSS files to html file.
#### Project uses HTML and CSS.
##### Original code and images were provided by Codecademy. CSS reset stylesheet from http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/
